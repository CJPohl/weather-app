# Weather App

### Purpose 
This is my approach to the Weather App project as assigned by The Odin Project.


### Features
- Enter a city name
- API call to fetch weather data from OpenWeather API
- Change between F or C

### Reflection
Comfort with vanilla JS writing and its common tools is increasing rapidly.  With the first project working with APIs, each new language and programming feature I pickup is being acquired faster due to this comfort.
